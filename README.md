## Feedback And Feature Requests
If you found a bug or want to share an idea on how to improve my UI, either report to [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/ls-/oUF_LS/issues?state=open) on my GitHub page, or post a comment on [WoWInterfrace](http://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info22662-oUFLS.html#comments) or [Curse](http://mods.curse.com/addons/wow/ouf-ls#comments).

Feel free to write feedback on how to improve some class-specific features, because I only play as PvE mage and PvP DK.

However, keep in mind that I'm not going to implement any features, as a replacement for *BIG* addons. I want my UI to be as lightweight as possible.
