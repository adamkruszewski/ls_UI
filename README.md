You're at development repository page of PvE-oriented oUF-based UI.

##Feedback And Feature Requests
If you found a bug or want to share an idea on how to improve my UI,
either report to [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/ls-/oUF_LS/issues?state=open)
on my GitHub page, or post a comment on [WoWInterfrace](http://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info22662-oUFLS.html#comments)
or [Curse](http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/ouf-ls#comments).

Feel free to write feedback on how to improve some class-specific
features, because I only play as PvE mage.

However, keep in mind that _I'm not going to implement any features,
as a replacement for **BIG** addons_. I want my interface to be as
lightweight as possible.

##Testing
If you wanna help testing new features, you can download available, if
any, beta version of my UI via _CurseClient_ by switching to beta
release channel.

Bear in mind that oUF LS [GitHub](https://github.com/ls-/oUF_LS) and
Beta versions may and will be _unstable_.
