#oUF LS
You're at development repository page of PvE-oriented oUF-based UI.

oUF LS not only replaces blizzard unit frames, but also customizes buttons, action bars, minimap, etc and provides some extra features.

**Versions 1.2.4 and below require [oUF](http://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info9994-oUF.html).**

#Download
- [WoWInterface](http://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info22662-oUFLS.html)
- [Curse](http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/ouf-ls)

#Features
##Supported Frames
Player, Pet, Target, Target of Target, Focus, Target of Focus, Party (w/o pets and targets), Bosses and Arena (w/ PvP trinket tracker).
No support for raid frames will be *ever* provided.

Player frame is split into *three* parts:

- Left - class resources, i.e. holy power, shadow orbs, etc;
- Centre - player health;
- Right - player power, i.e. mana, rage, etc.

##Supported Resources And Core Abilities
- Death Knight - Runes;
- Warlock - Demonic Fury, Burning Embers, Soul Shards;
- Priest - Shadow Orbs;
- Monk - Chi;
- Paladin - Holy Power;
- Shaman - Totems;
- Druid (Owl) - Lunar/Solar Energy;
- Rogue/Druid (Cat) - Combo Points.

##Other Modules
- Default UI elements, such as **ActionBars**, **MicroMenu**, **Minimap** and **Buttons**, are all customized;
- **Frame "movers"** for various interface elements;
- **Floating Combat Feedback** on player frame;
- **AuraTracker** for monitoring up to 8 buffs and debuffs on player character in total. List of auras can be managed via slash commands ingame and is saved per character. List of AuraTracker commands can be accessed via either dropdown menu or /atcmd slash command.
- **NamePlates**. Nice and clean look;
- And more.

#Feedback And Feature Requests
If you found a bug or want to share an idea on how to improve my UI, either report to [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/ls-/oUF_LS/issues?state=open) on my GitHub page, or post a comment on [WoWInterfrace](http://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info22662-oUFLS.html#comments) or [Curse](http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/ouf-ls#comments).

Feel free to write feedback on how to improve some class-specific features, because I only play as PvE mage.

However, keep in mind that I'm not going to implement any features, as a replacement for *BIG* addons. I want my interface to be as lightweight as possible.

#Testing
If you wanna help testing new features, you can download available, if any, beta version of my UI via CurseClient by switching to beta release channel.

Bear in mind that oUF LS [GitHub](https://github.com/ls-/oUF_LS) and Beta versions may and will be unstable.

#Credits
Credits go to **zork**, **Phanx**, **haste**, **p3lim**, **stako** and blizzardâ€™s artist, who drew default minimap texture!
